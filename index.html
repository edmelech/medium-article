        <h2>2020</h2>
        <p>
          Was a crazy year. As a DJ, I lost all my gigs and realised it was time to make a positive change and add more strings to my bow. I dabbled in code throughtout 2020 and then made the jump into a career in tech by joining the Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp batch #523.

        <h2>Music is my passion</h2>
        <p>
          When I am not spening my time looking over code I love to make and play music. I'm fascinated by the role of technology in music.

        <a href="https://youtu.be/0hiUuL5uTKc" class="link-medium">This is how you really do it</a>

        <h2>I'm excited about the future</h2>
        <p>
          It's an uncertain time for everyone at the moment, but it feels great to be setting my sights on a new challenge by learning to code.
